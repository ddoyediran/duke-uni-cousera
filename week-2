red = 100, green = 255, blue = 150. 

To test your function, you should choose an image and apply the swapRedGreen function to every pixel in the image. The choice of your image is important. 
For some images you may not notice any change. What would happen if you used a completely black image, or a completely white image? What about an image with 
lots of red and not a lot of green? Think about what type of image you should use for testing your function. After choosing an image and applying the swapRedGreen 
function to every pixel in the image, make sure you print the resulting image so you can see whether your
